# Calculator - FreeCodeCamp Certification Project ðŸŽ“

This project was developed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Certification program to demonstrate my understanding of frontend development principles, including:

- **Component-based architecture** with React
- **State management** using `useState` for handling user input and operations
- **Real-time calculations** using custom logic for operator precedence and mathematical operations
- **Dynamic UI updates** for seamless user interaction

## Live Demo ðŸš€
Check out the live demo of the project here: [Calculator](https://izzel24.github.io/calculator)

## How It Works ðŸ”§
1. **Basic Calculator Functions**: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using interactive buttons.
2. **Responsive Input**: The calculator updates the display in real-time as users input numbers and operators.
3. **Decimal Support**: Users can include decimal points for precise calculations.
4. **AC Button**: Resets the calculator to its initial state.
5. **Precedence Handling**: The calculator evaluates expressions with operator precedence (e.g., multiplication and division before addition and subtraction).
